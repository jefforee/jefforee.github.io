                <div id = "words"> 
                    <p>Have you ever been through a crisis when you just can't figure out where to eat? Have you gotten into arguments with someone because y'all can't decide on a place, or even blame each other for not thinking of a place to eat? Well this is a perfect website for the indecisive: girlfriend, boyfriend, friends, parents, siblings, cousins, distant aunt, great grandmother, pets, or even yourself. <br> <br> All of the listed restaurants are ones that I have tried and the items are ones that I suggest. I will continue to update this as I try more restaurants so feel free to follow me on my journey! :D</p>

                <h1>Origins</h1>
                <div id = "words"> 
                    <p>It all started when my girlfriend sent me a tiktok trend about this girlfriend being indecisive when it came to choosing restaurant for the couple to eat. The boyfriend decided to code up this program to generate random food locations so his girlfriend could stop calling him the indecisive one. Wait, this is sounding a lot like my relationship... so I thought why not make my own website that'll help us choose where to eat!</p>

                    <p>Heeeello! My name is Jeffrey Huang and I'm the creator of this website. My girlfriend and I love eating food but we are both indecisive so this came to be. I hope y'all enjoy using this and are able to try some new restaurants!</p>
